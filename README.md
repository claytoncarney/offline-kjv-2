## Offline KJV 2
An Offline KJV Bible Search Application for Android (also Windows and Linux).

This application is dedicated to our Lord Jesus Christ, YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH.

"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."

This is a major refactor of the [offline-kjv](https://github.com/claytoncarney/offline-kjv) repository. New features (tomes, bookmarks folders, search history, font size, themes, etc.). New techniques (ES6 modules, MVC, Flexbox, SVG, rollupjs, etc.).

The original KJV Apocrypha is also restored.

NOTE: Requires the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser.
